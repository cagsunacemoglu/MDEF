# Communication Strategy

It’s hard to get noticed in our world. With so much information around us, the variety of channels, combined with the fact that everyone has the power to become a creator or journalist; it’s important to figure out best way to communicate our projects to cut through the noise and get recognized. 

Considering the discussions in the design studio class, what stands for me as the most important aspects of the communication strategy are:
- Identifying the target audience
- Coming up with an original way of storytelling that fits well with the project
- Choosing the right medium for that story and target audience
- Being persistent

I believe the communication strategy of the project must fit well with the content of it so that they feel like one united, consistent thing. For that reason I feel it’s not possible to fully define and put into practice the communication strategy before deciding on the direction of the work. 
However, I do agree that those two should move together, so here are some ideas and principles that I’d like to follow in my communication strategy:

- Communicate the process: Being honest about vagueness, rather than communicating based on outcomes, only when outcomes are there.
- Asking for help from the people already working in the field, to spread the word. Can make it much easier than starting from scratch. Even consider turning it into a collective activity, rather than pursuing a personal pursuit.
- Using the mediums as they fit. Physical communication can be just as strong based on the need. But some form of digital communication is necessary for a broader audience to connect with  similar-minded people across the globe
- Fidelity of communication to align with the fidelity of the project; I don’t like the idea of creating fine-tuned, or shiny communication material for a project that’s in its early days. I’d like to pursue a more honest and transparent communication style.
- Data logging: Being an analytical person, and a data geek, I like the idea of auto-ethnography through collecting data. Especially if I can automate it so that it doesn’t require me to constantly create the comms myself.
- Leaving a trace of the project in physical space when it is closely related to a specific area or context. I always like the transitions from physical to digital, and ways to bridge the two. 
- Share my work as open-source; enable others to follow the same path and make it easy for them to not reinvent the wheel.
