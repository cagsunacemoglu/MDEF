# Communicating Ideas

I haven't been able to join the first session with Kate, but going through the deck, it seems we covered interesting content. 

Here's the work I've done so far to define the communications of my project. All that's here is work in progress and is subject to change as the project evolves.

## Outlining mission, vision and values

**Purpose:**
Design  and develop interventions that promote a harmonious, enjoyable and sustainable relationship between humans and water in the domestic space.


**Vision:**
We envision a world where people appreciate the value of water and view it not just as a resource to meet their needs, but as a vital component that sustains life that should be celebrated and conserved.


**Mission:**
Our mission is to use a combination of design, mindful utilisation of technology, behavioral science, and inspiring narratives to transform people's relationship with water in the domestic setting. 

We strive to develop interventions that encourage responsible use of water, foster a sense of connection to water, and also change the current paradigm of water technologies.

### Minimum Viable Message

Our relationship to water in our homes is broken. We treat it as if it's an unlimited commodity that we can use as much as we like, contaminate and dispose. The technologies we use to manage water makes water hidden in our living spaces as well, along with all the problems that we prefer not to see.

This project is about designing  and developing interventions that promote a harmonious, enjoyable and sustainable relationship between humans and water in the domestic space. 

Ultimately, the aim is to change how we relate to water, for people to appreciate the value of water and not view it just as a resource to meet their needs, but as a vital component that sustains life that should be celebrated and conserved.
