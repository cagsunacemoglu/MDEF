# Designing for the Next 1B Seconds

## Reflection

The seminar began with the question, "What do we want to remember in a billion seconds from now?" And it continued with other philosophical questions aimed at directing our critical thinking to a variety of topics: what is everything, inter citizenship, interspecies solidarity, current economic systems, the state of the digital...

It was a great playground to ask ourselves where we are as humanity, where we are going, and we had the opportunity to think critically about what we see in our world today. An important realization for me was that as much as we can criticize everything we see in the world, we need to remember that those who can be held responsible are people just like us. The people we blame for all wrongs we see in the world are also us: they are a different version of ourselves, realized in a different context. I think it's important to challenge the "us versus them" type of thinking if we really want to make a difference in the world. It's easy to forget, but we should see our differences as opportunities.

Speaking of processes: I also came across the theory of process philosophy in this seminar. Quoting A.N.Whitehead, "It is the view that actuality consists not made up of individual objects with attributes, but rather of interwoven processes."
e.g. an "atom" does not exist as an isolated substance with essential and accidental properties, but is rather an abstraction denoting a temporal process consisting of myriad elements which are constantly in flux, these elements also constituting other processes.

Simply put, the idea that life is not composed of materials and atoms, but of processes. The river cannot be said to be a thing, because it is a process that is not the same at two different times. And this is true of everything. As much as they appear to be rigid, material things... everything is subject to change. This sticked with me right away.


Other interesting notes that I took for myself:
* The positionally statement: The best way I saw someone present themselves so far. Grateful for having come across this resource: [Positionality, Intersectionality, and Privilege](https://www.mitemmc.org/monthly-tips/positionality-intersectionality-and-privilege-in-health-professions-education-research/)
* Importance of defining the “We”: We talk about we without defining who that is and everyone assumes something. We for the seminar was the people in this room.
* Critical hope as a proposal. I also liked Caglar’s challenge that hope is so important for him that it needs to remain clean and pure of criticism. For me the term was also confusing in the sense that I thought “critical hope” was meant to refer to hope that is critically important.
* Andres identifying himself as a slow researcher: Reminded me that researching doesn’t have to mean leaving everything behind and  just focusing your life in your research topic.
* How boring and problematic is predicting the future when there’s invention, imagination and participation in the futures.
* The plurality of futures: That there’s not going to be a single future. There’s not even a single present. 
* I loved the idea that time != money but time = life! Such a simple and beautiful way to put it.
* Environmental emergency is not a design problem  you can solve. You cannot solve emergencies. That humans can’t save the world but we can care for it.
* The warning Andres made to be careful about the narratives thrown at us: Like “the cloud”, “moving fast & breaking things”,  “social media” …
* And “moving slow and repairing things” as an alternative.
* Individualism vs. Individuality: That individualism is problematic as it takes the human as the centre of the world.
* Words changing worlds, and the power of storytelling as another good, timely reminder to myself.
* And as a last word, let us not forget that transformations are already happening everywhere, but they are mostly not visible, the media is not talking about it, but there are many, many people working on it.

“Write a first draft of a letter sent by your future self in the 2050’s“

![](https://i.imgur.com/FAeg7FT.jpg)

I do not want to reproduce the whole transcript of the letter, but here is an excerpt from it:

*"...All these developments have made it crystal clear that what matters in life is who you connect with: The relationships you nourish, who is around you, how much you love, and how much you are loved in return.*

*So if you are receiving this letter, my message to you is to work on your ability to love. For those who did not know how to do that, life became extremely boring after the whole era of technological progress obsession was over.*

*When humanity realized that we had everything we needed, for those who lost the love in themselves, things suddenly became meaningless. Only those who loved were seemingly considering themselves alive..."*

We are in the museum of boundaries, a billion seconds from 2022. This is what I wrote for my slide: 

*A billion seconds ago, people used to throw their trash each day into the bins on the streets. It's incredible to think that each household would throw away multiple bags of trash every - single - day.*

*Today in our society waste is a thing of the past. The problem got escalated when the municipality recognised that they've been steadily growing the size of the trash bins and now each of them has become the size of a small van!*

*They decided to utilise degrowth principles and behaviour science to change the trajectory of this. They first informed citizens that trash that remains outside of the bins would not be collected.*

*Then year after year, they reduced the size of the trash bins. This created a friction at first, neighbours were competing to dispose of trash first when there's still place in the bins. But people started reducing thier waste innately to not get crossed with their neighbours. Sometimes they would talk to each other to moderate the days.*

*Slowly and slowly, trashbins got smaller and smaller. In the meantime other waste collection initiatives grew because waste became valuable. All organic waste, plastic, paper and glass was being collected and reused within the local boundaries by some production facilities. Only few materials were treated specially, but that's rather a rare case.*
