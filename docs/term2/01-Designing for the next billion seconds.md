# Designing for the Next 1B Seconds

## Reflection

The seminar began with the question, "What do we want to remember in a billion seconds from now?" And it continued with other philosophical questions aimed at directing our critical thinking to a variety of topics: what is everything, inter citizenship, interspecies solidarity, current economic systems, the state of the digital...

It was a great playground to ask ourselves where we are as humanity, where we are going, and we had the opportunity to think critically about what we see in our world today. An important realization for me was that as much as we can criticize everything we see in the world, we need to remember that those who can be held responsible are people just like us. The people we blame for all wrongs we see in the world are also us: they are a different version of ourselves, realized in a different context. I think it's important to challenge the "us versus them" type of thinking if we really want to make a difference in the world. It's easy to forget, but we should see our differences as opportunities.

Speaking of processes: I also came across the theory of process philosophy in this seminar. Quoting A.N.Whitehead, "It is the view that actuality consists not made up of individual objects with attributes, but rather of interwoven processes."
e.g. an "atom" does not exist as an isolated substance with essential and accidental properties, but is rather an abstraction denoting a temporal process consisting of myriad elements which are constantly in flux, these elements also constituting other processes.

Simply put, the idea that life is not composed of materials and atoms, but of processes. The river cannot be said to be a thing, because it is a process that is not the same at two different times. And this is true of everything. As much as they appear to be rigid, material things... everything is subject to change. This sticked with me right away.


Other interesting notes that I took for myself:
* The positionally statement: The best way I saw someone present themselves so far. Grateful for having come across this resource: [Positionality, Intersectionality, and Privilege](https://www.mitemmc.org/monthly-tips/positionality-intersectionality-and-privilege-in-health-professions-education-research/)
* Importance of defining the “We”: We talk about we without defining who that is and everyone assumes something. We for the seminar was the people in this room.
* Critical hope as a proposal. I also liked Caglar’s challenge that hope is so important for him that it needs to remain clean and pure of criticism. For me the term was also confusing in the sense that I thought “critical hope” was meant to refer to hope that is critically important.
* Andres identifying himself as a slow researcher: Reminded me that researching doesn’t have to mean leaving everything behind and  just focusing your life in your research topic.
* How boring and problematic is predicting the future when there’s invention, imagination and participation in the futures.
* The plurality of futures: That there’s not going to be a single future. There’s not even a single present. 
* I loved the idea that time != money but time = life! Such a simple and beautiful way to put it.
* Enivronmental emergency is not a design problem  you can solve. You cannot solve emergencies. That humans can’t save the world but we can care for it.
* The warning Andres made to be careful about the narratives thrown at us: Like “the cloud”, “moving fast & breaking things”,  “social media” …
* And “moving slow and repairing things” as an alternative.
* Individualism vs. Individuality: That individualism is problematic as it takes the human as the centre of the world.
* Words changing worlds, and the power of storytelling as another good, timely reminder to myself.
* And as a last word, let us not forget that transformations are already happening everywhere, but they are mostly not visible, the media is not talking about it, but there are many, many people working on it.
