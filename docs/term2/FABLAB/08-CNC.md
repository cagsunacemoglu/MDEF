# CNC

In the CNC class, we received a lot of detailed information about this technology and how to manufacture things for our purposes. The content was very good and interesting and based on the huge amount of information included, my takeaway was that this is a whole profession and some people probably spend all their professional lives on becoming an expert on this.

## Task

We are lucky to have such experts in the Fablab, and for the task I worked with Josep who was detail oriented and guided me through every step of the process. The design I chose came out good enough to build a functioning furniture for my son that we’re now using in our kitchen every day.

It’s great to have the possibility to build custom designs with incredible accuracy in the Fablab. I wish I had ongoing access to such a machine to keep on building useful things. However, after building this piece of furniture, I now appreciate more the furniture we buy from stores, recognising how hard it's to make them error-free and much work goes into it to make it easy for us to assemble them. Even having drill holes on both sides of the wood feel like such a luxury now that I’ve seen how much effort it takes to cut one piece of wood only on one side.
