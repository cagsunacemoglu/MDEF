# 3D Fabrication & Scanning


## Reflection

In this course, we covered a wide range of topics, from the history of 3D printing to various printing technologies to 3D scanning.

The diagram below gave a good overview, but I realized that in order to understand each of these technologies, it is best to try them out and learn what considerations you should make for the method you want to use. Having an expert you can consult is essential given the variety of techniques available today, even in our Fablab.

My main takeaway from the course and exercises is that while it's amazing that these technologies have become so accessible, that does not mean they have been simplified to the level of, say, Ikea furniture that almost anyone can build with sufficient quality; there's still a lot to learn and intricate details to consider while modeling, layering and printing in order to 3D print good quality things that can have a long lifetime.

## Tasks

The exercise was to scan something and print something.

### 3d Scanning

I tried 3D scanning using my iPad which apparently has Lidar sensor integrated. (I had never used that sensor before)

My first attempt at 3D scanning was with a miniature flower. I used the Polycam app, which is a popular 3D scanning app for mobile devices. However, the app struggled to detect the solid shapes of the flower’s leaves and petals. The app appeared to be confused by the flower’s multi-layered shape, resulting in a poor 3D model. This experience taught me that 3D scanning of objects with intricate and complex shapes can be challenging for even so called advanced mobile apps.

For my second attempt, I tried 3D scanning a small statue from Fablab                                                     using both Lidar and non-Lidar versions of the same scan. I was surprised to find that the non-Lidar scan produced a higher quality 3D model than the Lidar scan I made. I'm guessing that may be due to  Lidar sensors being more effective in detecting rooms and 3d spaces, but when it comes to scanning objects, maybe they're not helping much or I may be missing some settings.

In conclusion, my experiences with 3D scanning have been educational. I’ve learned that 3D scanning is still a developing technology that has limitations, and it can be challenging to capture full details of complex objects. Additionally, the type of scanning technology used is crucial and can significantly impact the quality of the final 3D model.

### 3d Printing

To test 3D printing, [I downloaded a model](https://pinshape.com/items/7962-3d-printed-soap-holder) since I don’t have any 3D modeling experience. 

I decided to print a soap dish that I found online using black PLA material. 
Through this experience, I learned that there are numerous settings to consider when 3D printing, such as the printer and material to use, to produce a functioning outcome. Without knowing the printer’s specifications and the type of material to use, it can be challenging to produce high-quality 3D prints.

Those put aside, 3D printing was an incredibly fulfilling experience (In this task and later in our design challenge). It’s amazing to imagine an object, design it digitally, and then physically create it using a 3D printer. The ability to create something physical from nothing through digital tools is almost magical.

Lastly, I learned that thinking about how to print a design is just as important as the design itself. When designing for 3D printing, it’s crucial to consider factors such as print orientation, infill density, and support structures to ensure that the print is successful and of high quality.

Through this exercise, I finally was able to try 3D printing which I wanted to do for years. For me personally, there's a lot I have to learn in terms of 3d modelling and actually even before that first 3d thinking. I was struggling to imagine how things would work in 3d in our design challenge, although I had it clearly sketched on 2d. Geometrical thinking is a muscle I have to flex, and I'm looking forward to doing it in my future projects.
