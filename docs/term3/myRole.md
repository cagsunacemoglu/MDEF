## My role in this alternative present:

My role as a designer is to design interventions to inspires this change of perception. In this context, to design means: Coming up with intervention ideas, involving others, empowering them, facilitating the process to bring these ideas to the world by situating them in the right places and exposing them to people in a meaningful way.
