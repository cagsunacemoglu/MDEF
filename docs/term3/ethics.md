# Design Ethics

I truly enjoyed the design ethics class.

A few points that are worth highlighting:

Upon reflecting on the class content, I found myself particularly drawn to the notion that technology has become an inescapable part of our lives and that we now inhabit a "technosphere." This idea highlights just how integral technology has become to society, influencing everything from communication patterns to daily routines.

As someone who spent significant time working within corporate environments, I couldn't help but recognize some of my own tendencies towards tech-solutionism. However, after delving into this text and exploring alternative perspectives on technological advancement, I am hopeful for new ways of thinking about our relationship with it.

One quote that struck me as particularly insightful was: "we see nature as a problem, and we fixed it - and that's what we have now." Not only is this statement elegantly phrased; it also offers up an opportunity space for reimagining human interactions with the natural environment -illuminated potential areas where shifts could be made moving forward.
