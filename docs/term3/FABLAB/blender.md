# Blender

In today’s class, we learned about
- Blender’s history
- Philosophy of the tool and its management team
- Their Business model explorations
- The basic interactions of the tool
- The various features it has
- How its interfaces are organised
- How its architecture is organised

It was great to learn the basics about it, however, it would have been good to touch it during the session, to be better prepared for the next session where we’ll be connecting external sensors and use Blender as an interface-building tool.

I’m glad there’s a truly open-source tool that exists in this crowded corner of the software market, which is usually quite expensive. Thanks to Blender I imagine a lot of people with less resources have access to this creative space.  I’d like to invest more time to learn about Blender and make it the tool for my 3d modelling practice.
