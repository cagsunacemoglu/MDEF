# Live Coding

In this class we learnt about the world of live coding and various applications of it. It is an extremely interesting field to explore due to the creative opportunities it creates. 

I personally had very little exposure to this field before this class, only knowing that Python is a line by line executed language which you can write code that immediately gets executed - no need to compile.

Apparently, the field is much richer now, with live visualisations and live music making through code being so accessible, even through a browser window. 

We played with “Hydra” as a playground and in a small amount of time, we were able to come up with interesting visualisations. Well, to be fair, the random button already generates great visualisations so what we went through in class was just the satisfaction of creating something that looks beatiful just by playing with some parameters and changing the called functions. 

I’d like to keep exploring this field for possible applications on my projects: The possibility to connect to a Midi controller, making music through code and connecting to any sensor seem like great possibilities that could be applied to many projects.

Here is a quick [live coding sketch](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?code=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) I made based on example codes of Hydra and SonicPi - making me feel like a DJ on the stage.  :)
