# Distributed Design

In this seminar, we had the opportunity to discover IAAC’s approach to distributed design through some of the frameworks that were developed under our school’s academic environment, like the mushroom model and the reflection tree.

## Day 1: Mushroom Model
We developed our mushroom model on a fundamental product that we chose, “the bread”.

### Reflection:

Skills:
- Systems thinking: Map connections and think about relationships
- Listening: Understand other approaches of the other teams and integrate them back to our process

Dynamics:
- The flow was very dynamic and we had fast paced conversations on various topics changing the topic quite quickly.
- It less organised/facilitated, more organic.

Interactions:
- Sharing of what was discussed in other tables clarified some points, and I recognised that every team has something to learn from others and other products.

Did the role I played influence my opinion?


## Reflection Tree

I missed the following day activies in person and completed them on my own. I completed the activity for the latest prototype of our project, which is a circular kitchen sink using the same water over and over again by filtering it through various filter stages.

### Reflection:

Skills:
- Critical Thinking: I needed to assess our project as objectively as possible for the given criteria
- Systems Thinking: TO do this assessment, you need to understand the interconnections between your project and the systems in place, and relate the parameters of your project against them.

Dynamics:
- It would have been better to do this exercise as a group, discussing the details and haivng a conversation around where our project is meeting and not meeting the criteria of the reflection tree. 

Interactions:
- My role as one of the designers behind the project for sure influenced my opinion. One one side, I know all our intentions that are not yet realised that makes me score against the intentions, not the realities. On the other side, I guess I'm a bit biased to score ourself higher as I want the project to fullfill these criteria.
