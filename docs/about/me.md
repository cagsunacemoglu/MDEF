# About


I am a designer specializing in user experience, creative technology, and innovation strategy. My work is focused on contributing to a more purposeful, fair, and kind future.

In addition to my career as a service and business designer, I am working on [an initiative aimed at challenging our relationship with water in our homes.](https://cagsunacemoglu.github.io/MDEF/term3/myRole/)

In this systematic problem space, I see my role as a designer to come up with interventions that inspire a change of perception. To me, design in this context means generating intervention ideas, involving others, empowering them, facilitating the process to bring these ideas to the world by using or bringing together the relevant skills, and situating and exposing these interventions to people in a meaningful way.
