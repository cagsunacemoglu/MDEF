I used to love it, to be exact. I remember the first walkman I had and the impact it did in my life through recording and exchanging cassettes: It elevated my life quality in a way I couldn\u2019t have imagined, provided a new way to express myself, and connected me with my friends in a way that wasn\u2019t possible before. All these led me to choose to study engineering in electronics, thinking that I would be designing and producing such products, and help people improve their lives in ways they wouldn\u2019t even be able imagine. Then I broke up with technology. Somewhere along the road, something went very wrong, that technology started being a threat: It started manipulating us, monetising us and using our data against us. It became a tool of consumerism that nothing but profits started to matter. What promised to connect us, started disconnecting us. And so on, and on. Despite these bitter feelings I\u2019ve inside, when I think about it, I feel that technology is still humanity\u2019s best bet to solve some of the huge issues we have: To bring back the health of our planet, to create more equality, to elevate the potential of each of us, or to create enjoyable moments that connect us. Doing that, is in the scope of the designers work. It\u2019s designers that needs to have certain values, and shape technologies in such ways to make these possible. So the question is: How can we design things, products or interventions in a way that they don\u2019t exploit neither humans, nor the nature; but they actually elevate their well-being. In summary, have can we make technology again a source of inspiration, hope and positive change? That is my fight.

As surfaced in my \u201cfight\u201d poster; I\u2019ve been bitterly observing how technology transformed to being perceived as a threat to the health of individuals and societies. The main question I\u2019d like to explore - as described in my fight- is: How can we make tech a source of optimism, kindness and progress for the well-being of all species? To that end, I chose some weak signals and trigger cards that I\u2019m willing to explore, and I\u2019ve ideated some interventions as initial ideas to give some direction to this broad field I\u2019m inclined to work in. My idea is to work on some of the following opportunity areas -possibly by drifting serially- to explore if/how tech can help transform the status quo in these spaces and create positive impact that would not be possible without it. Some of these interventions depend less on tech than others, which is okay. Technology is such a broad term that one way or another will play a role in design, creation or distribution of these ideas. While I\u2019ve placed technology in the centre, I must mention that the main goal of these projects in not \u201ctechnology for technology\u2019s sake\u201d. My goal is to work on projects that create well-being and harmony for people and the rest of nature: Mindful, ethical and kindly designed technology is just the medium through which I intend to work towards that goal. With that said, it should not be a surprise that the cards \u201cMindful Technology\u201d, \u201cKind Tech\u2019 and \u201cTechnology for Equality\u201d form the common ground for my design space. The intersection of this common ground with other cards create the following opportunity spaces that I can possibly work on in my projects: Can we reimagine social media to create physical connections that get us out of monetised digital spaces? Can revamping an object with biomaterials, great design and technology induce behaviour change in a positive way? Can we make connect universal basic wage possible by connecting it to personal carbon emissions? How can technology display a kind presence in our cities? Can tech be used for an alternative way of sharing beyond economic gains? Can we reimagine social media to create physical connections that get us out of monetised digital spaces? Can we imagine a new way of travelling in which our trips contribute to local progress towards a more regenerative and sustainable future? Can technology help create empathy for non-humans? How much tech does it take to be self-sustaining and living off the grid?","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"Technology has been central in my life: It shaped me as a child, helped me get through my adolescence and shaped my an identity as I moved to adulthood.
