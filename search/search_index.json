Which ones you haven\u2019t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you? \u00b6 Role 1 - Prototype as experimental component \u00b6 The prototype itself is the object about which design knowledge is sought through the experimental setup. In my profession, we often employ these types of prototypes in the field of \u201cBusiness Design\u201d. When we come up with a new business idea, we first extract the assumptions we\u2019re making by asking ourselves the question: \u201cWhat needs to be true for our idea to work?\u201d Once we have the most important assumptions identified and framed as hypothesis, we try to test them as quickly and cheaply as possible. And we employ prototypes for that. One type of prototype we use is a landing page: A webpage created just to present the idea and see if it resonates by measuring how people respond to it. I also did some usability tests: To do that, we create a realistic prototype and observe how users interact with it. We aim to find flaws in the design or interesting findings based on how the user interacts with the prototype. Role 2 - Prototype as means of inquiry. \u00b6 Prototypes have been developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry, in much the way that scientists use specifically designed instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena. In one instance, I was working on a project where the goal was to develop a device that would be sent to examine a drilled hole under the earth in order to map the trajectory of the hole. To first test the environmental conditions, we designed a prototype that would go under such a hole, and just experience the conditions there so that we could understand our design constraints for the actual device. The result of that inquiry wasn\u2019t as we hoped for: Conditions underground were so tough that our \u201ctest the water\u201d prototypes couldn\u2019t return from the hole having captured the data we needed, due to not being able to withhold the shocks and physical conditions of our target environment. Role 3 - Prototype as research archetype. \u00b6 Research archetypes are physical embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary. While I\u2019m not sure, if this falls into this category, the example that comes to my mind is something we do in many of our projects in service design. In those projects, we are usually commissioned to design and deliver a usable, tangible end product, which could be the design of a digital product or the blueprint of how a service will function. On the path to delivering that final outputs, we usually also work on an intermediate deliverable that illustrates an idealistic vision of what could be the limits of what we\u2019re designing. The goal of this prototype (funny that we never called these prototypes, but rather call them concept designs to increase their credibility) is to inspire and create excitement in people for the possibilities of the project. We are almost sure at that point that this vision wouldn\u2019t be implemented immediately or even in the near term. However, these design concepts lead to interesting conversations, get people aligned on the vision, and usually help us gain buy-in for upcoming deliveries. An example of this is an \u201cidealistic customer journey map\u201d where the experience of a customer is prototyped in a way that everything goes extremely positively for both the customer and the company in a way that sets the example for how each customer interaction should be. Role 4 - Prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. \u00b6 There are a number of ways that the process of making an artefact is instrumental in doing design research. In these cases, the process of prototyping becomes a means of inquiry, akin to a research method.The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted. This role of prototyping is something we use a lot in participatory workshops. Sometimes we do it using Legos; where we ask participants to build something together, and in the activity, they learn so much about the design challenge itself, they find themselves discussing important aspects of the project or they come up with new ideas by being inspired by what comes across in the process. Another way we do this is by asking participants to role-play a certain service (which is what we are designing in this case). We ask one of the participants to be a customer, whereas others may be working for the service provider company. By improvising their role, they start to expose key aspects of the service: the rest of the participants observe them and take notes that could give direction to the rest of the design process. Assignment 1b: Select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use. \u00b6 While the prototype I\u2019d decide to employ will depend on the actual project and the problem I\u2019m trying to solve, I find role 4 very interesting especially, due to the first-person perspective of the master\u2019s program. I have tried role 4 in co-creation settings and this time I\u2019m interested in using it for a first-person-driven inquiry: to study myself as I go through the design and prototyping process. I have some other interventions in mind that require Role 2 and Role 1 prototyping, but I\u2019d like to keep it open for any new ideas to emerge and not make decisions too soon on which methods to use.

For this assignment, I picked the article titled \u201cClean up\u201d that was published in MIT Technology Review on Aug 24 th , 2022 as it touches on some interesting topics that was relevant to the seminar we had. The article is a news piece about an exciting invention that a Phd student, Christoff-Tempesta, made: He took the idea of a cell membrane - which allows things to move in and out of cells selectively- and he was able to combine it with a very thin platform structure made of nanofibers that would hold it together so that\u2019s is not unstable in its shape like a cell membrane.

And why did it matter? What happens when you involve yourself? What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? Did anything change about your way of working? What does it mean for your future work? After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? 1 - What did you make? And why did it matter? \u00b6 In the initial assignment to make a companion, I made a machine that could help me control time, with the hope that it would give me a relief and let go of FOMO (fear of missing out). But it didn\u2019t. I started thinking too much about time, and when to use my companion. The moments when used it started to become too precious, when it wasn\u2019t. Then in the second one part of the seminar, where we needed to come up with a personal intervention, I did an uto-ethnographic data collection on how I use technology. Technology is an anchor topic for what I\u2019d like to work on in this master, so I wanted to study my relationship with it before coming up for interventions for others using it.

Very quickly after testing my prototypes, I recognised that the way things really work is very different to how we imagine they\u2019d work. Unexpected things happen. You recognise how you perceive these unexpected things. This results in either a self-realisation, or a new angle to look at your design - both of which are very useful. I reflected on the fact that when designing for others, this happens as well and things we don\u2019t imagine happening naturally emerge. Involving myself allowed me to understand this fact in an embodied way. 3 - What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? \u00b6 I started interacting with my ideas - continued seeing them as design artifacts that are still in the making, when they were actually complete for the given task. The design activity continued due to the fact that the design and the designer were still there. And within this interaction, something unexpected happened, the design started to change designer as well. My experience with my companion was so different to how I assumed it to be, so I started reflecting and questioning my relationship with time, which in turn made me decide to alter my relationship with time. The companion didn\u2019t do the job itself, which it was supposed to do, but it did actually do the job in an alternative way within the interaction it had with me. 4 & 5 - Did anything change about your way of working?What does it mean for your future work? \u00b6 In my profession, we tend to focus on designing for others, and to do that responsibly, I work hard to take myself out of the equation when I design. As if our personal involvement is something to be ashamed of, something unprofessional\u2026 During the seminar, I recognised that taking yourself completely out of the equation is not possible; the designer is always there with their values, their way of seeing life, and how they understand the problem at hand. The seminar gave me the courage to acknowledge this fact, and make use of it rather than trying to avoid it. As a matter of fact, I think in my past projects, I did a better job as a designer when I\u2019m personally more involved with the problem we were designing for. I\u2019ll try 1PP design and utilising the results of it where possible in my professional work. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll at least allow me to communicate better with the target audience, after having embodied the problem. 6 - After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? \u00b6 Works like this help us connect to each other in many layers; not only in terms of the interest areas of others, but also in a human level. With this extended understanding, ideas on paper become more clear, they get some more colour and it becomes easier to spot the opportunities to collaborate.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#assignment","text":"What did you make?

The sessions covered topics such as the role of the designer, approaches to systems transformation, tools for facilitation, and the use of our bodies as epistemological instruments. For me one of the highlights of the seminar was the concept of transition design, which I became aware of only in this seminar. Transition design seems to have recognised and conceptualised many of the issues I have experienced in my practise as a service designer. Having found a theoretical framework and vocabulary to talk about these issues, is something I\u2019ll benefit on my professional journey. I also enjoyed the distinction that was made between designing over / for / with / within. While I understand that \u201cdesigning within\u201d leads to superior results due to personal immersion of the designer into the problem space and utilisation of the wisdom of the collective; I wonder if there\u2019ll always be cases of designing for & with others because not all design challenges may allow the designer to be fully involved in target communities. Some examples that come to my mind are if you\u2019re designing for dogs, other species, for the elderly as a young designer or if you\u2019re designing for kids\u2026 Does this mean that there\u2019ll always be a case for participatory design where you have to design \u201cfor\u201d or design \u201cwith\u201d in the best case? I\u2019m curious if the ultimate solution is \u201cspecialised\u201d designers, who work as integrated designers only within specific communities they immerse themselves into and do not design anything beyond the boundaries of that community. It\u2019s a curious question to explore. Jumping to another note, the Group Works card deck was a good tool to facilitate a discussion around \u201cfacilitation\u201d. While facilitation is a huge topic in itself, I enjoyed the curation that Holon did to provide a quick intro into all these huge topics we touched upon in the seminar. However it\u2019s required to dig into the resources of the seminar which I will copy below for my own benefit. I picked the card about \u201cemergence\u201d, which has been one of my biggest recognitions and learning from this master degree so far: Getting comfortable with seperation from predefined rigid plans & structures and allowing for observation and following gut feelings without scientific proof to navigate complex challenges. All in all, I believe that many subjects of the seminar required a deeper-dive and it was a lot of ground to cover in a single week. I felt the need to explore the systems mapping of our \u201cactants\u201d more rigiorously, and I was expecting to learn more about the nitty-gritty of community engagement: How to start interacting with, immersing into and designing within a community. Without these skills, I feel a bit vulnerable and lost as a designer, as if I\u2019d blame myself for doing the wrong thing if I\u2019m designing for & with others but I don\u2019t have much of a clue about doing it the right way: \u201cdesigning within\u201d. But maybe these questions are valuable enough as awareness raisers that will allow me to keep exploring, and evolve my practice for better.

Week 1 - Forensics of the Obsolescence \u00b6 We spent the first one doing a forensic study where we did a detailed examination of a non-working device. In our case, the device we chose was a conference call camera, which had a satellite microphone unit. The camera sits on a gimbal that turns it to the direction from which the loudest voice comes. It was a lot to unpack and dismantle. For me it was very enjoyable, to explore the inner workings of such a complicated device. From an engineering perspective, there was a lot of detailed work that went into this device, not only in terms of electronics, but also mechanically, to make a movable device controlled by the input of sound. And making sure that no cable is visible to the end-user, which they seem to have spent a lot of energy on. We took it apart to find out lots of different electronic boards, a camera unit with many optical pieces, microphones, motors to move the camera, individual lenses, and many screws, cables, and supporting materials. We were lucky to find many parts which were good candidates for reuse. While breaking it apart, we had some interesting conversations, about the design decisions they made, and how difficult they made it for the consumer to use this device in the long term. This device which originally costed more than 3000 , was now available for 10 , was now available for 10 on the second hand market. We elaborated on the reasons for this, the engineering choices made the device unusable after a few years, due to propriority elements that are needed to keep this device functional: The camera unit was useless without its own server: It didn\u2019t work with any other computer. We couldn\u2019t even connect it to a computer to try it, because even the ports they used were proprietary. At the end of the day, a microprocessor chip on one of the boards costs more than the price of the whole unit: which is a good sentiment to what happens if you don\u2019t work on the longevity of a design\u2026 Leaving aside the politics of how corrupt the engineering on this device was, as a team, we had a good number of parts to use for our second week. The forensic report of the first week is available on this link. Week 2 - Almost useless machine \u00b6 In the second week, we were supposed to recreate a useless machine based on the parts we had from the first week. Our instructors wanted us to follow a \u201cTinkering\u201d process to ideate: Play with what we have to see what emerges. I found the process interesting and refreshing. In my professional practice, I utilise different ideation methods, and I really enjoyed trying something different than a structured ideation process. It might also be due to the fact that in our group it worked quite well. While it was difficult to let go of the usual way of brainstorming at first, we were then able to just tinker, try a few different things and come up with a concept and narrative that our team was happy with. From then on, it was about trying to make things work, and once it does, see if it works as we imagined it to be and fine-tune and adapt. There were cases where we had to adapt the machine based on what emerged rather than what we initially imagined. Overall, I appreciated the improvisation aspect of the workshop and had a lot of fun: in my opinion the idea of reutilising parts from an old machine to build something new (and imperfect) was the perfect recipe for bringing together creativity, satisfaction of making things and hard work as a team. Once we assembled all the pieces in a system that constituted our useless machine, we shot our video, and enjoyed watching the never ending clockwork of our machine that fulfills no purpose.

It was a lot to take in, but I guess, if you only have 2 days, that\u2019s probably the only way to cover so much information. By introducing the ideas briefly and opening new windows in our minds that we can follow later if we prefer to. Artistic Explorations \u00b6 After the initial 2 days, our seminar continued with the assistance of Estampa. One of their first sessions was to go through some artistic explorations, which was eye-opening. It was refreshing to see some alternative ways of utilising AI beyond the regular high-tech usages we see in the media; which is always concerning in some way or another. I enjoyed seeing uses of AI that don\u2019t ring an alarm bell but inpires your imagination. Getting Hands-on \u00b6 The rest of the seminar was more hands-on; we first learned to use Google Colab. I greatly enjoyed it as I wasn\u2019t aware of these technologies before. I found it almost magical to start running such complex code without even touching your local system. There\u2019re no risks, you cannot break your system, it\u2019s just a free laboratory you can experiment with in minutes. The possibilities we have today are incredible, even compared to 5 years ago when you had to sort out lots of system level installations, packages, dependencies, etc. before you could get started with a first line of code. Now even the code is there to start with and you only need to press play if you fancy playing with it. The other thing I find truly impressive is the amount of open libraries, models, datasets, scientific papers you can find online. Our instructors showed us a few resources, and basically all the resources that all the teams in our class required were accessible within those websites. The only thing we had to do was to try different options and see what works. Without even writing a single line of code, our team was able to try out face recognition, speech-to-text conversation, emotion detection, emotionally intelligent chat bot conversation, and text to speech generation technologies which I find amazing. Concluding Reflections \u00b6 The seminar left me thinking of the conundrum in this field: While many are worried about AI and the unknowns of what\u2019s being developed in this technical space, and the ethics of these black boxes; in my experience, it\u2019s also the most open, accessible, and technically advanced field that welcomes newcomers with open arms.

Asking for help from the people already working in the field, to spread the word. Can make it much easier than starting from scratch. Even consider turning it into a collective activity, rather than pursuing a personal pursuit. Using the mediums as they fit. Physical communication can be just as strong based on the need.

An important realization for me was that as much as we can criticize everything we see in the world, we need to remember that those who can be held responsible are people just like us. The people we blame for all wrongs we see in the world are also us: they are a different version of ourselves, realized in a different context.

So if you are receiving this letter, my message to you is to work on your ability to love. For those who did not know how to do that, life became extremely boring after the whole era of technological progress obsession was over.

It\u2019s incredible to think that each household would throw away multiple bags of trash every - single - day. Today in our society waste is a thing of the past. The problem got escalated when the municipality recognised that they\u2019ve been steadily growing the size of the trash bins and now each of them has become the size of a small van! They decided to utilise degrowth principles and behaviour science to change the trajectory of this. They first informed citizens that trash that remains outside of the bins would not be collected. Then year after year, they reduced the size of the trash bins. This created a friction at first, neighbours were competing to dispose of trash first when there\u2019s still place in the bins. But people started reducing thier waste innately to not get crossed with their neighbours. Sometimes they would talk to each other to moderate the days. Slowly and slowly, trashbins got smaller and smaller. In the meantime other waste collection initiatives grew because waste became valuable. All organic waste, plastic, paper and glass was being collected and reused within the local boundaries by some production facilities. Only few materials were treated specially, but that\u2019s rather a rare case.

During the roasting process, the husk falls off and has usually been left behind; sometimes used as a fertilizer or just thrown away with the rest of the trash. Story Behind: \u00b6 Coffee husks have a long history of use in coffee-growing regions, where they were originally discarded as waste. However, in recent years, coffee husks have gained attention as a potential resource for sustainable materials, as they are abundant and renewable. The use of coffee husks in material production can be traced back to countries such as Brazil and Vietnam, where they have been utilized as a source of fuel and fertilizer. In recent years, coffee husks have also been used to create a variety of products such as biodegradable packaging materials, composite materials for construction, and even beauty products. The popularity of coffee husk as a material has grown as more people become concerned about waste reduction and sustainability. As coffee is a widely grown crop, coffee husks have the potential to make a significant impact on the materials industry if utilized properly. Properties: \u00b6 Functional Technical Emotional lightweight recyclable joyful strong water resistant calm papery heat resistant natural Possible Applications: \u00b6 Coffee cups : Actually https://huskee.co/ is doing just that, and they are beautiful coffee cups that elevate the joy of having coffee, due to a great harmony of the cup with the beverage. I have one of these cups and I love it. It\u2019s nice to hold, keeps coffee warm, well designed that cleaning it is easy and sipping through it is perfect with a soft touch of the material on the lips. Building material : Apparently this is also happening. A construction company from Colombia has made an eco-friendly, low-income housing material from coffee husks. The company, called Woodpecker WPC, turns husks and other waste from coffee production process into prefabricated blocks used for construction. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdXLG_W9a6I&t=1s 2) A material from references - Pine needles \u00b6 Pine needles is an abundant, overlooked and unwanted material which can actually be developed into a 100% bio-based, recyclable and compostable bio-composite material. Story Behind: \u00b6 \u2018Cheer Project\u2019 is a research done on pine needles by Gaurav MK Wali in Himachal Pradesh which is a state of India that is at the foothills of the Himalayas. It is known for its quaint valleys and snow-covered mountains. Most of this beauty is made by the pine forest, with a cover of about forty thousand square kilometres. But the state is facing menacing environmental complications caused by the fallen leaves of pine trees called pine needles. The imbalance caused by these needles has a huge impact on life and the entire ecosystem that far exceeds our imagination. From forest fires, water scarcity to unemployment. Beneath the surface, something huge has gone wrong and has not grabbed anyone\u2019s attention but we can all feel its effect in our daily lives. Cheer Project offers a sustainable and socially-viable solution to the environmental hazards caused by an overabundance of dried pine needles on the forest floor. Through a holistic approach, Cheer Project\u2019s production process unveils the dormant potential of pine needles while also empowering indigenous communities by creating livelihood opportunities for them. The proposed modus operandi is circular: raw material is procured by indigenous communities from nearby pine forests, the collected needles are then processed into a fiber with low-cost machinery, this pine fiber is further mixed with natural binders to make the pine composite. This bio-composite material can be used by local artisans to manufacture sustainable products and revenue generated through their sale will further strengthen the rural economy while restoring the pride of the locals in their work. Properties: \u00b6 Functional Technical Emotional flexible 100% bio-based locally-built water repellent compostable nice touch fire retardant recyclable wood smell Possible Applications: \u00b6 Vegan leather applications : Shoes, wallets, bags\u2026 Isolation and covering : Table mats, floor mats, coasters 3) An ideal material - Clay-like glass \u00b6 Glass that you can shape with your hands and give a form which can be then fixed by freezing it. It can also be remelted after being frozen thus making it a 100% recyclable material. Story Behind: \u00b6 Glass is a beatiful material but it\u2019s limited by its rather complicated physical characteristics that allows it to be only shaped under high heat. By combining the properties of clay and glass, scientists were able to create a clay-like glass which can be shaped by hand. Unlike clay, the way to fix the shape is freeze it to less than 20 degrees celcius, and once frozen the shape is kept until it\u2019s melted. More artists started working with glass and this led to glass becoming a creative craft that can be enjoyed from children to elderly. Properties: \u00b6 Functional Technical Emotional transparent recyclable smooth touch durable freezes at -20 degrees celcius bright stiff melts at 250 degrees celcius beautiful Possible Applications: \u00b6 Modeling with glass 3d printing with glass End of Seminar Project \u00b6 In our final project, we explored a bio alternative to silicon. All of us in the team were working with water in our interventions and one thing you recognise when you work with water tools and systems is that there\u2019s a lot of plastic and silicon involved. We wanted to address this problem and seeked a bio alternative solution: Talking to our instructors, we learnt that shellac - a material we did not know of- could be an alternative and we started looking for the material, which we found in a chemistry shop, and we started experimenting with it. We made a number of explorations and put the material to use in different contexts. Some of them were quite successful, such as gluing high surface area materials together for a leak free connection or closing small cracks on plastic surface with shellac was actually stopping the water flow if applied properly. We elaborated on the properties, strengths, weaknessses of the material and the recipes in our presentation below. < /iframe","title":"Remixing Materials"},{"location":"term2/02-Remixing%20Materials/#remixing-materials","text":"The seminar introduced us to the world of bio-based materials and upcycling, with an emphasis on hands-on learning and prototyping.

Unlike clay, the way to fix the shape is freeze it to less than 20 degrees celcius, and once frozen the shape is kept until it\u2019s melted.

All of us in the team were working with water in our interventions and one thing you recognise when you work with water tools and systems is that there\u2019s a lot of plastic and silicon involved. We wanted to address this problem and seeked a bio alternative solution: Talking to our instructors, we learnt that shellac - a material we did not know of- could be an alternative and we started looking for the material, which we found in a chemistry shop, and we started experimenting with it. We made a number of explorations and put the material to use in different contexts. Some of them were quite successful, such as gluing high surface area materials together for a leak free connection or closing small cracks on plastic surface with shellac was actually stopping the water flow if applied properly. We elaborated on the properties, strengths, weaknessses of the material and the recipes in our presentation below. < /iframe","title":"End of Seminar Project"},{"location":"term2/MicroChallenge%20I/","text":"Micro Challenge 1 \u00b6 As we were a team of people interested in working with water in the domestic space, we chose to work on a water quality measurement system that could be useful to assess water as part of a filtration or cultivation system. We researched that to assess the quality of water, a number of sensors were required. We decided to go for pH and EC (electro conductivity - an indicator of the amount of solids in water sensors) and temperature (to make sense of EC which is dependent on the temperature of water) which were available in Fablab. After deciding on these, it was possible to break the project down into smaller pieces of work and attack them by smaller teams. While some of us worked on the physical design of the unit, I worked on electronics: Making the EC sensor work, integrating a pump to flow the water that will be measured and bringing together the system. All code and other documentation is in the project repo: Water explorations for Microchallenges Using Parrot as an EC Sensor \u00b6 It turned out to be a technically complicated challenge: The EC sensor we chose to use was an off-the-shelf product called Parrot, due to being abundantly available in Fablab. To make it work, we had to use an open source library that was written in Node; thus we had to use a Raspberry Pi that could run Node code. GitHub - sandeepmistry/node-flower-power: node.js lib for the Parrot Flower Power It took me and Mikel more than a day to make the base installations to be able run the open source library without errors, and get some readings from the EC sensor. Then I simplified the code to only get the EC, and temperature data we need. Integrating a Pump \u00b6 Integrating a pump was rather easy, I found a simple resource that explains how to run a motor through a MOSFET, that ran smoothly in the first try. Transistor Motor Control | Arduino Documentation | Arduino Documentation Integrating the Electronic System \u00b6 So, we had a system that consisted of - a Raspberry Pi that talks to the EC sensor (Parrot) - an Arduino that talks to the Ph sensor and runs the pump I established serial communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, such that Arduino acts like a sensor that transmits Ph reading continuously until a button is pressed. When someone presses the button, Arduino runs the pump and an EC measurement is done. Reflection \u00b6 There have been positive personal and team learnings from the project: It was an accelerated learning experience for me to work with Raspberry Pi, which I have not been exposed to before. On the team level, I think working on a water-tight unit that we can programmatically pump water into was very nice. The sensors need more work for calibration and making sense, we are getting some readings which look accurate, but we don\u2019t know what it tells us in terms of water quality. Overall, I think the project quickly turned into an engineering challenge, maybe too deep for the purpose of this micro challenge. In the next challenges I\u2019d prefer to go less technical, and focus on something that generates more meaningful results in the human scale, possibly through using some of the learnings from this challenge.

It\u2019s amazing how easy and enjoyable it is, to research some code online and making it work within minutes: I feel grateful for all the open-source developers that paved the way to make this possible. /* Melody Plays a melody by Tom Igoe This example code is in the public domain. http://www.arduino.cchttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Tone */ #include \"pitches.h\" // notes in the melody: int melody[] = { NOTE_C4, NOTE_G3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_A3, NOTE_G3, 0, NOTE_B3, NOTE_C4 }; // note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.: int noteDurations[] = { 4, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 }; void setup() { // iterate over the notes of the melody: for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < 8; thisNote++) { // to calculate the note duration, take one second divided by the note type. //e.g. quarter note = 1000 / 4, eighth note = 1000/8, etc. int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote]; tone(23, melody[thisNote], noteDuration); // to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them. // the note's duration + 30% seems to work well: int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30; delay(pauseBetweenNotes); // stop the tone playing: noTone(23); } } void loop() { // no need to repeat the melody. } And the pitches.h file that contains the notes below: /************************************************* * Public Constants *************************************************/ #define NOTE_B0 31 #define NOTE_C1 33 #define NOTE_CS1 35 #define NOTE_D1 37 #define NOTE_DS1 39 #define NOTE_E1 41 #define NOTE_F1 44 #define NOTE_FS1 46 #define NOTE_G1 49 #define NOTE_GS1 52 #define NOTE_A1 55 #define NOTE_AS1 58 #define NOTE_B1 62 #define NOTE_C2 65 #define NOTE_CS2 69 #define NOTE_D2 73 #define NOTE_DS2 78 #define NOTE_E2 82 #define NOTE_F2 87 #define NOTE_FS2 93 #define NOTE_G2 98 #define NOTE_GS2 104 #define NOTE_A2 110 #define NOTE_AS2 117 #define NOTE_B2 123 #define NOTE_C3 131 #define NOTE_CS3 139 #define NOTE_D3 147 #define NOTE_DS3 156 #define NOTE_E3 165 #define NOTE_F3 175 #define NOTE_FS3 185 #define NOTE_G3 196 #define NOTE_GS3 208 #define NOTE_A3 220 #define NOTE_AS3 233 #define NOTE_B3 247 #define NOTE_C4 262 #define NOTE_CS4 277 #define NOTE_D4 294 #define NOTE_DS4 311 #define NOTE_E4 330 #define NOTE_F4 349 #define NOTE_FS4 370 #define NOTE_G4 392 #define NOTE_GS4 415 #define NOTE_A4 440 #define NOTE_AS4 466 #define NOTE_B4 494 #define NOTE_C5 523 #define NOTE_CS5 554 #define NOTE_D5 587 #define NOTE_DS5 622 #define NOTE_E5 659 #define NOTE_F5 698 #define NOTE_FS5 740 #define NOTE_G5 784 #define NOTE_GS5 831 #define NOTE_A5 880 #define NOTE_AS5 932 #define NOTE_B5 988 #define NOTE_C6 1047 #define NOTE_CS6 1109 #define NOTE_D6 1175 #define NOTE_DS6 1245 #define NOTE_E6 1319 #define NOTE_F6 1397 #define NOTE_FS6 1480 #define NOTE_G6 1568 #define NOTE_GS6 1661 #define NOTE_A6 1760 #define NOTE_AS6 1865 #define NOTE_B6 1976 #define NOTE_C7 2093 #define NOTE_CS7 2217 #define NOTE_D7 2349 #define NOTE_DS7 2489 #define NOTE_E7 2637 #define NOTE_F7 2794 #define NOTE_FS7 2960 #define NOTE_G7 3136 #define NOTE_GS7 3322 #define NOTE_A7 3520 #define NOTE_AS7 3729 #define NOTE_B7 3951 #define NOTE_C8 4186 #define NOTE_CS8 4435 #define NOTE_D8 4699 #define NOTE_DS8 4978 /* The Godfather Connect a piezo buzzer or speaker to pin 11 or select a new pin.

I was fascinated by the Origami simulation and appreciated computer-aided modeling software that can convert 3D designs into different 2D fabrication models. Without this software, I would not be able to break down a 3D object into its 2D pieces, so I\u2019m grateful that these tools exist. For the exercise, I decided to laser-cut an airplane model that I found online, as I don\u2019t have any modeling skills yet. You can download the model for free from the following link. https://3axis.co/download/lop08z1w/ Preparing the model for cutting was not as easy as I thought. Adai explained to me that it would be ideal to cut different hole sizes to find the one that fits the material I chose the best. As the laser eats away some material while cutting, the holes in the model become larger than what is designed in the software, resulting in wobbly end products. I chose 2.8mm thick plywood, but after cutting some test pieces and trying different cut sizes, I found that a 2.76mm height worked best. So, I altered my model based on this material height. The trick was to find the section in the model that needs to be equal to the material height and scale the whole model so that section is 2.76mm. After that, I colored my model layers with the correct colors that the laser cutter would recognize and sent the file to the cloud. However, the laser cutter didn\u2019t recognize my raster layers that were in black. Adai and I figured out that this may have been because the lines were too thin while being transferred from Inkscape (CDR) to DXF, then from DXF to Rhino 5 format, and the software may not have recognized the original line weight. After entering the correct parameters for the material I chose, I was able to start cutting, but it didn\u2019t cut in the first try. Adai suggested making the process slower and adding a little bit of power. Doing that, the material was cut, and I repeated the cut once more to have two airplanes to compare. After that, it was fun to construct the planes that came without instructions. I\u2019m amazed by the possibilities this process creates. One can create many small items for the house, toys, puzzles, and craft pieces with access to a laser cutter. If you have access to a larger one, you can even create custom furniture.

Exercise 1 - Parametric Modelling of a Croissant \u00b6 In Exercise 1, which involved parametric modeling of a croissant, I quickly sketched a rough design on paper using my non-existent drawing skills. The idea is (from top view) that there are two intersecting curves, with several cuts across the surface between them. The distance between the cuts and the radius of those section determine the rough shape of the croissant. The reality is much more complex of course, and this made me recognise that even a simple everyday object like a croissant is such a complicated design at the moment of creation. The other takeaway for me was that sometimes it\u2019s much easier to design things with our hands: You can shape a croissant from dough but designing that on a software is rather difficult.

(It was also surprising to me that it\u2019s not possible to draw something directly in Rhino and press a button that transforms it into a parametric version.) So I started from scratch and build a parametric system step by step. First step was to define the points that make up the rectangle. First I started with static points that defined a rectangle by adding a Rect2Pt object and define 2 points manually. The panel was showing that a rectangle was created although it\u2019s not visible on screen. Then I added a BoxRec object with variable height that can be adjusted by a slider. By doing this, the height of the prism was parametrised.

For me, it was interesting to see how networks are architectured by incapsulating the same information on multiple layers, so that the information can arrive at the destination without being harmed. The analogy that I came up with that it finally made sense for me is shipping an item to the other end of the world, for instance, to a place like Alaska. You need to layer your item in multiple layers so that it survives the whole journey: - a bubbled air bag as first layer to protect it in the local van that makes the first transfer, - a cardboard box to make it\u2019s safe for the airplane, - a plastic bag, so that it doesn\u2019t get wet across the ocean in a ship, - a heat isolated bag, so that it doesn\u2019t get too cold on the way to Alaska from the port\u2026 I guess information travelling over networkds is like that, it moves across multiple continents, between many vehicles that carry information, and it needs to be compatible with the systems that carry it, similar to shipping company standards, they need to be in certain sizes and packages, and they stick labels on them so that anyone on the road can identify the item. In the last part of the class, we worked on practically establishing a network. I found it interesting that there needs to be a broker - a moderator in the system even when we wanted to send messages from one to another. Similarly, it was also surprising for me to learn that the information we share with companies go to their headquarters and get processed/routed there to wherever it\u2019s stored. I always assumed that the network would be decentralised, and each node of the system would be able to handle the information so that the central processing doesn\u2019t get overloaded. I\u2019d want to explore that a bit more. The highlight of building such a network for me was being able to build a local area network over WLAN where machines can talk to each other, send commands and requests, and collaborate without having to connect over the Internet. I think this opens up a lot of possibilities to create a kind of intelligence in the local space through talking devices that do not need any human intervention. We followed the following code with Dhriti to establish connection to the local network and send messages to the class, and receive their messages in return. https://hackmd.io/CAj0Y8O3QGKjmH2b4r3Tag?view","title":"Networking"},{"location":"term2/FABLAB/05-Networking/#networking","text":"In the class about networking, we started with discussing what a network is, and elaborated on the philosophical aspects of what are the basic functions of networks, and the design decisions that went behind the networks we know today. For me, it was interesting to see how networks are architectured by incapsulating the same information on multiple layers, so that the information can arrive at the destination without being harmed. The analogy that I came up with that it finally made sense for me is shipping an item to the other end of the world, for instance, to a place like Alaska. You need to layer your item in multiple layers so that it survives the whole journey: - a bubbled air bag as first layer to protect it in the local van that makes the first transfer, - a cardboard box to make it\u2019s safe for the airplane, - a plastic bag, so that it doesn\u2019t get wet across the ocean in a ship, - a heat isolated bag, so that it doesn\u2019t get too cold on the way to Alaska from the port\u2026 I guess information travelling over networkds is like that, it moves across multiple continents, between many vehicles that carry information, and it needs to be compatible with the systems that carry it, similar to shipping company standards, they need to be in certain sizes and packages, and they stick labels on them so that anyone on the road can identify the item. In the last part of the class, we worked on practically establishing a network.

I think it was as a great flow of exercises, because LEDs are fun to play with, they\u2019re simple to work with but visually appealing and allow for creativity. The step by step approach was also really nice to build up as we go, and at the end we ended up creating something quite cool, a central server lighting up the LEDs of the whole class through inputs from anyone in the class. The highlights for me were - Discovering about the jLED animation library : I wouldn\u2019t guess there\u2019d be a library for seemingly simple functions like LED lighting, but now I\u2019d think about checking out existing libraries before creating something new - Learning about node-red and how it works in high-level. It was also good to learn about in conjunction with MCCT, although I\u2019d need some time to work with these tools, to understand exactly how they work and what their capabilities are. - The ease of creating a connection with a server with a few lines of code, and communicating over wifi through an Arduino device is mind blowing. I hope I get the chance to work with this capability in my design challenges & interventions. Here\u2019re some references to materials we used in the class: - Course material: https://hackmd.io/95FEOJXeSXe9hDu289X-bw?view - Node Red: https://nodered.org/ - MQTT Broker: https://mosquitto.org/ - My code to diversify the responses based on incoming messages #include \"Arduino.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); Serial.begin(9600); } void blink () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } void blinkFast () { int i=0; while(i<20){ digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); i++; } // wait for a second } void blinkX (int reps) { int i=0; while(i<reps){ digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); i++; } // wait for a second } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"a\")){ blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"c\")){ blink(); blink(); blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b\")){ blink(); blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"fast\")){ blinkFast(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b5\")){ blinkX(5); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b50\")){ blinkX(50); } } } Here is the final video of the collective lighting up of multiple LEDs via the server, via an online interface that can be controlled by anyone in the class. Oscar had shown us a video of a dance show with coordinated and synchronized LED masks at the beginning of the course. We achieved the core functionality of this show (synchronous control of multiple devices over a local network) within 3-4 hours, which is a mind-blowing result that shows the accessibility level of today\u2019s technology.","title":"Interfaces - Machine Interactions"}]}
