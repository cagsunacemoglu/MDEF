Which ones you haven\u2019t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you? \u00b6 Role 1 - Prototype as experimental component \u00b6 The prototype itself is the object about which design knowledge is sought through the experimental setup. In my profession, we often employ these types of prototypes in the field of \u201cBusiness Design\u201d. When we come up with a new business idea, we first extract the assumptions we\u2019re making by asking ourselves the question: \u201cWhat needs to be true for our idea to work?\u201d Once we have the most important assumptions identified and framed as hypothesis, we try to test them as quickly and cheaply as possible. And we employ prototypes for that. One type of prototype we use is a landing page: A webpage created just to present the idea and see if it resonates by measuring how people respond to it. I also did some usability tests: To do that, we create a realistic prototype and observe how users interact with it. We aim to find flaws in the design or interesting findings based on how the user interacts with the prototype. Role 2 - Prototype as means of inquiry. \u00b6 Prototypes have been developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry, in much the way that scientists use specifically designed instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena. In one instance, I was working on a project where the goal was to develop a device that would be sent to examine a drilled hole under the earth in order to map the trajectory of the hole. To first test the environmental conditions, we designed a prototype that would go under such a hole, and just experience the conditions there so that we could understand our design constraints for the actual device. The result of that inquiry wasn\u2019t as we hoped for: Conditions underground were so tough that our \u201ctest the water\u201d prototypes couldn\u2019t return from the hole having captured the data we needed, due to not being able to withhold the shocks and physical conditions of our target environment. Role 3 - Prototype as research archetype. \u00b6 Research archetypes are physical embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary. While I\u2019m not sure, if this falls into this category, the example that comes to my mind is something we do in many of our projects in service design. In those projects, we are usually commissioned to design and deliver a usable, tangible end product, which could be the design of a digital product or the blueprint of how a service will function. On the path to delivering that final outputs, we usually also work on an intermediate deliverable that illustrates an idealistic vision of what could be the limits of what we\u2019re designing. The goal of this prototype (funny that we never called these prototypes, but rather call them concept designs to increase their credibility) is to inspire and create excitement in people for the possibilities of the project. We are almost sure at that point that this vision wouldn\u2019t be implemented immediately or even in the near term. However, these design concepts lead to interesting conversations, get people aligned on the vision, and usually help us gain buy-in for upcoming deliveries. An example of this is an \u201cidealistic customer journey map\u201d where the experience of a customer is prototyped in a way that everything goes extremely positively for both the customer and the company in a way that sets the example for how each customer interaction should be. Role 4 - Prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. \u00b6 There are a number of ways that the process of making an artefact is instrumental in doing design research. In these cases, the process of prototyping becomes a means of inquiry, akin to a research method.The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted. This role of prototyping is something we use a lot in participatory workshops. Sometimes we do it using Legos; where we ask participants to build something together, and in the activity, they learn so much about the design challenge itself, they find themselves discussing important aspects of the project or they come up with new ideas by being inspired by what comes across in the process. Another way we do this is by asking participants to role-play a certain service (which is what we are designing in this case). We ask one of the participants to be a customer, whereas others may be working for the service provider company. By improvising their role, they start to expose key aspects of the service: the rest of the participants observe them and take notes that could give direction to the rest of the design process. Assignment 1b: Select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use. \u00b6 While the prototype I\u2019d decide to employ will depend on the actual project and the problem I\u2019m trying to solve, I find role 4 very interesting especially, due to the first-person perspective of the master\u2019s program. I have tried role 4 in co-creation settings and this time I\u2019m interested in using it for a first-person-driven inquiry: to study myself as I go through the design and prototyping process. I have some other interventions in mind that require Role 2 and Role 1 prototyping, but I\u2019d like to keep it open for any new ideas to emerge and not make decisions too soon on which methods to use.

For this assignment, I picked the article titled \u201cClean up\u201d that was published in MIT Technology Review on Aug 24 th , 2022 as it touches on some interesting topics that was relevant to the seminar we had. The article is a news piece about an exciting invention that a Phd student, Christoff-Tempesta, made: He took the idea of a cell membrane - which allows things to move in and out of cells selectively- and he was able to combine it with a very thin platform structure made of nanofibers that would hold it together so that\u2019s is not unstable in its shape like a cell membrane. Thinking of the impressive capabilities of cell-membranes, I found this to be a high-potential discovery that could unlock many use-cases.
