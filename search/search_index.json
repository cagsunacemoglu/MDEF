Which ones you haven\u2019t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you? \u00b6 Role 1 - Prototype as experimental component \u00b6 The prototype itself is the object about which design knowledge is sought through the experimental setup. In my profession, we often employ these types of prototypes in the field of \u201cBusiness Design\u201d. When we come up with a new business idea, we first extract the assumptions we\u2019re making by asking ourselves the question: \u201cWhat needs to be true for our idea to work?\u201d Once we have the most important assumptions identified and framed as hypothesis, we try to test them as quickly and cheaply as possible. And we employ prototypes for that. One type of prototype we use is a landing page: A webpage created just to present the idea and see if it resonates by measuring how people respond to it. I also did some usability tests: To do that, we create a realistic prototype and observe how users interact with it. We aim to find flaws in the design or interesting findings based on how the user interacts with the prototype. Role 2 - Prototype as means of inquiry. \u00b6 Prototypes have been developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry, in much the way that scientists use specifically designed instruments to collect, record and measure phenomena. In one instance, I was working on a project where the goal was to develop a device that would be sent to examine a drilled hole under the earth in order to map the trajectory of the hole. To first test the environmental conditions, we designed a prototype that would go under such a hole, and just experience the conditions there so that we could understand our design constraints for the actual device. The result of that inquiry wasn\u2019t as we hoped for: Conditions underground were so tough that our \u201ctest the water\u201d prototypes couldn\u2019t return from the hole having captured the data we needed, due to not being able to withhold the shocks and physical conditions of our target environment. Role 3 - Prototype as research archetype. \u00b6 Research archetypes are physical embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary. While I\u2019m not sure, if this falls into this category, the example that comes to my mind is something we do in many of our projects in service design. In those projects, we are usually commissioned to design and deliver a usable, tangible end product, which could be the design of a digital product or the blueprint of how a service will function. On the path to delivering that final outputs, we usually also work on an intermediate deliverable that illustrates an idealistic vision of what could be the limits of what we\u2019re designing. The goal of this prototype (funny that we never called these prototypes, but rather call them concept designs to increase their credibility) is to inspire and create excitement in people for the possibilities of the project. We are almost sure at that point that this vision wouldn\u2019t be implemented immediately or even in the near term. However, these design concepts lead to interesting conversations, get people aligned on the vision, and usually help us gain buy-in for upcoming deliveries. An example of this is an \u201cidealistic customer journey map\u201d where the experience of a customer is prototyped in a way that everything goes extremely positively for both the customer and the company in a way that sets the example for how each customer interaction should be. Role 4 - Prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. \u00b6 There are a number of ways that the process of making an artefact is instrumental in doing design research. In these cases, the process of prototyping becomes a means of inquiry, akin to a research method.The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted. This role of prototyping is something we use a lot in participatory workshops. Sometimes we do it using Legos; where we ask participants to build something together, and in the activity, they learn so much about the design challenge itself, they find themselves discussing important aspects of the project or they come up with new ideas by being inspired by what comes across in the process. Another way we do this is by asking participants to role-play a certain service (which is what we are designing in this case). We ask one of the participants to be a customer, whereas others may be working for the service provider company. By improvising their role, they start to expose key aspects of the service: the rest of the participants observe them and take notes that could give direction to the rest of the design process. Assignment 1b: Select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use. \u00b6 While the prototype I\u2019d decide to employ will depend on the actual project and the problem I\u2019m trying to solve, I find role 4 very interesting especially, due to the first-person perspective of the master\u2019s program. I have tried role 4 in co-creation settings and this time I\u2019m interested in using it for a first-person-driven inquiry: to study myself as I go through the design and prototyping process. I have some other interventions in mind that require Role 2 and Role 1 prototyping, but I\u2019d like to keep it open for any new ideas to emerge and not make decisions too soon on which methods to use.

For this assignment, I picked the article titled \u201cClean up\u201d that was published in MIT Technology Review on Aug 24 th , 2022 as it touches on some interesting topics that was relevant to the seminar we had. The article is a news piece about an exciting invention that a Phd student, Christoff-Tempesta, made: He took the idea of a cell membrane - which allows things to move in and out of cells selectively- and he was able to combine it with a very thin platform structure made of nanofibers that would hold it together so that\u2019s is not unstable in its shape like a cell membrane.

And why did it matter? What happens when you involve yourself? What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? Did anything change about your way of working? What does it mean for your future work? After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? 1 - What did you make? And why did it matter? \u00b6 In the initial assignment to make a companion, I made a machine that could help me control time, with the hope that it would give me a relief and let go of FOMO (fear of missing out). But it didn\u2019t. I started thinking too much about time, and when to use my companion. The moments when used it started to become too precious, when it wasn\u2019t. Then in the second one part of the seminar, where we needed to come up with a personal intervention, I did an uto-ethnographic data collection on how I use technology. Technology is an anchor topic for what I\u2019d like to work on in this master, so I wanted to study my relationship with it before coming up for interventions for others using it.

Very quickly after testing my prototypes, I recognised that the way things really work is very different to how we imagine they\u2019d work. Unexpected things happen. You recognise how you perceive these unexpected things. This results in either a self-realisation, or a new angle to look at your design - both of which are very useful. I reflected on the fact that when designing for others, this happens as well and things we don\u2019t imagine happening naturally emerge. Involving myself allowed me to understand this fact in an embodied way. 3 - What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? \u00b6 I started interacting with my ideas - continued seeing them as design artifacts that are still in the making, when they were actually complete for the given task. The design activity continued due to the fact that the design and the designer were still there. And within this interaction, something unexpected happened, the design started to change designer as well. My experience with my companion was so different to how I assumed it to be, so I started reflecting and questioning my relationship with time, which in turn made me decide to alter my relationship with time. The companion didn\u2019t do the job itself, which it was supposed to do, but it did actually do the job in an alternative way within the interaction it had with me. 4 & 5 - Did anything change about your way of working?What does it mean for your future work? \u00b6 In my profession, we tend to focus on designing for others, and to do that responsibly, I work hard to take myself out of the equation when I design. As if our personal involvement is something to be ashamed of, something unprofessional\u2026 During the seminar, I recognised that taking yourself completely out of the equation is not possible; the designer is always there with their values, their way of seeing life, and how they understand the problem at hand. The seminar gave me the courage to acknowledge this fact, and make use of it rather than trying to avoid it. As a matter of fact, I think in my past projects, I did a better job as a designer when I\u2019m personally more involved with the problem we were designing for. I\u2019ll try 1PP design and utilising the results of it where possible in my professional work. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll at least allow me to communicate better with the target audience, after having embodied the problem. 6 - After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? \u00b6 Works like this help us connect to each other in many layers; not only in terms of the interest areas of others, but also in a human level. With this extended understanding, ideas on paper become more clear, they get some more colour and it becomes easier to spot the opportunities to collaborate.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20Your%20Own%20Ideas/#assignment","text":"What did you make?

The sessions covered topics such as the role of the designer, approaches to systems transformation, tools for facilitation, and the use of our bodies as epistemological instruments. For me one of the highlights of the seminar was the concept of transition design, which I became aware of only in this seminar. Transition design seems to have recognised and conceptualised many of the issues I have experienced in my practise as a service designer. Having found a theoretical framework and vocabulary to talk about these issues, is something I\u2019ll benefit on my professional journey. I also enjoyed the distinction that was made between designing over / for / with / within. While I understand that \u201cdesigning within\u201d leads to superior results due to personal immersion of the designer into the problem space and utilisation of the wisdom of the collective; I wonder if there\u2019ll always be cases of designing for & with others because not all design challenges may allow the designer to be fully involved in target communities. Some examples that come to my mind are if you\u2019re designing for dogs, other species, for the elderly as a young designer or if you\u2019re designing for kids\u2026 Does this mean that there\u2019ll always be a case for participatory design where you have to design \u201cfor\u201d or design \u201cwith\u201d in the best case? I\u2019m curious if the ultimate solution is \u201cspecialised\u201d designers, who work as integrated designers only within specific communities they immerse themselves into and do not design anything beyond the boundaries of that community. It\u2019s a curious question to explore. Jumping to another note, the Group Works card deck was a good tool to facilitate a discussion around \u201cfacilitation\u201d. While facilitation is a huge topic in itself, I enjoyed the curation that Holon did to provide a quick intro into all these huge topics we touched upon in the seminar. However it\u2019s required to dig into the resources of the seminar which I will copy below for my own benefit. I picked the card about \u201cemergence\u201d, which has been one of my biggest recognitions and learning from this master degree so far: Getting comfortable with seperation from predefined rigid plans & structures and allowing for observation and following gut feelings without scientific proof to navigate complex challenges. All in all, I believe that many subjects of the seminar required a deeper-dive and it was a lot of ground to cover in a single week. I felt the need to explore the systems mapping of our \u201cactants\u201d more rigiorously, and I was expecting to learn more about the nitty-gritty of community engagement: How to start interacting with, immersing into and designing within a community. Without these skills, I feel a bit vulnerable and lost as a designer, as if I\u2019d blame myself for doing the wrong thing if I\u2019m designing for & with others but I don\u2019t have much of a clue about doing it the right way: \u201cdesigning within\u201d.

Week 1 - Forensics of the Obsolescence \u00b6 We spent the first one doing a forensic study where we did a detailed examination of a non-working device. In our case, the device we chose was a conference call camera, which had a satellite microphone unit. The camera sits on a gimbal that turns it to the direction from which the loudest voice comes. It was a lot to unpack and dismantle. For me it was very enjoyable, to explore the inner workings of such a complicated device. From an engineering perspective, there was a lot of detailed work that went into this device, not only in terms of electronics, but also mechanically, to make a movable device controlled by the input of sound. And making sure that no cable is visible to the end-user, which they seem to have spent a lot of energy on. We took it apart to find out lots of different electronic boards, a camera unit with many optical pieces, microphones, motors to move the camera, individual lenses, and many screws, cables, and supporting materials. We were lucky to find many parts which were good candidates for reuse. While breaking it apart, we had some interesting conversations, about the design decisions they made, and how difficult they made it for the consumer to use this device in the long term. This device which originally costed more than 3000 , was now available for 10 , was now available for 10 on the second hand market. We elaborated on the reasons for this, the engineering choices made the device unusable after a few years, due to propriority elements that are needed to keep this device functional: The camera unit was useless without its own server: It didn\u2019t work with any other computer. We couldn\u2019t even connect it to a computer to try it, because even the ports they used were proprietary. At the end of the day, a microprocessor chip on one of the boards costs more than the price of the whole unit: which is a good sentiment to what happens if you don\u2019t work on the longevity of a design\u2026 Leaving aside the politics of how corrupt the engineering on this device was, as a team, we had a good number of parts to use for our second week. The forensic report of the first week is available on this link. Week 2 - Almost useless machine \u00b6 In the second week, we were supposed to recreate a useless machine based on the parts we had from the first week. Our instructors wanted us to follow a \u201cTinkering\u201d process to ideate: Play with what we have to see what emerges. I found the process interesting and refreshing. In my professional practice, I utilise different ideation methods, and I really enjoyed trying something different than a structured ideation process. It might also be due to the fact that in our group it worked quite well. While it was difficult to let go of the usual way of brainstorming at first, we were then able to just tinker, try a few different things and come up with a concept and narrative that our team was happy with. From then on, it was about trying to make things work, and once it does, see if it works as we imagined it to be and fine-tune and adapt. There were cases where we had to adapt the machine based on what emerged rather than what we initially imagined. Overall, I appreciated the improvisation aspect of the workshop and had a lot of fun: in my opinion the idea of reutilising parts from an old machine to build something new (and imperfect) was the perfect recipe for bringing together creativity, satisfaction of making things and hard work as a team. Once we assembled all the pieces in a system that constituted our useless machine, we shot our video, and enjoyed watching the never ending clockwork of our machine that fulfills no purpose. Here are our final presentation and video from the workshop.","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"We had two weeks hands-on time with electronics.","title":"Tech beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#week-1-forensics-of-the-obsolescence","text":"We spent the first one doing a forensic study where we did a detailed examination of a non-working device.

It was a lot to take in, but I guess, if you only have 2 days, that\u2019s probably the only way to cover so much information. By introducing the ideas briefly and opening new windows in our minds that we can follow later if we prefer to. Artistic Explorations \u00b6 After the initial 2 days, our seminar continued with the assistance of Estampa. One of their first sessions was to go through some artistic explorations, which was eye-opening. It was refreshing to see some alternative ways of utilising AI beyond the regular high-tech usages we see in the media; which is always concerning in some way or another. I enjoyed seeing uses of AI that don\u2019t ring an alarm bell but inpires your imagination. Getting Hands-on \u00b6 The rest of the seminar was more hands-on; we first learned to use Google Colab. I greatly enjoyed it as I wasn\u2019t aware of these technologies before. I found it almost magical to start running such complex code without even touching your local system. There\u2019re no risks, you cannot break your system, it\u2019s just a free laboratory you can experiment with in minutes. The possibilities we have today are incredible, even compared to 5 years ago when you had to sort out lots of system level installations, packages, dependencies, etc. before you could get started with a first line of code. Now even the code is there to start with and you only need to press play if you fancy playing with it. The other thing I find truly impressive is the amount of open libraries, models, datasets, scientific papers you can find online. Our instructors showed us a few resources, and basically all the resources that all the teams in our class required were accessible within those websites. The only thing we had to do was to try different options and see what works. Without even writing a single line of code, our team was able to try out face recognition, speech-to-text conversation, emotion detection, emotionally intelligent chat bot conversation, and text to speech generation technologies which I find amazing. Concluding Reflections \u00b6 The seminar left me thinking of the conundrum in this field: While many are worried about AI and the unknowns of what\u2019s being developed in this technical space, and the ethics of these black boxes; in my experience, it\u2019s also the most open, accessible, and technically advanced field that welcomes newcomers with open arms.

Considering the discussions in the design studio class, what stands for me as the most important aspects of the communication strategy are: - Identifying the target audience - Coming up with an original way of storytelling that fits well with the project - Choosing the right medium for that story and target audience - Being persistent I believe the communication strategy of the project must fit well with the content of it so that they feel like one united, consistent thing. For that reason I feel it\u2019s not possible to fully define and put into practice the communication strategy before deciding on the direction of the work. However, I do agree that those two should move together, so here are some ideas and principles that I\u2019d like to follow in my communication strategy: Communicate the process: Being honest about vagueness, rather than communicating based on outcomes, only when outcomes are there. Asking for help from the people already working in the field, to spread the word. Can make it much easier than starting from scratch. Even consider turning it into a collective activity, rather than pursuing a personal pursuit. Using the mediums as they fit. Physical communication can be just as strong based on the need. But some form of digital communication is necessary for a broader audience to connect with similar-minded people across the globe Fidelity of communication to align with the fidelity of the project; I don\u2019t like the idea of creating fine-tuned, or shiny communication material for a project that\u2019s in its early days. I\u2019d like to pursue a more honest and transparent communication style. Data logging: Being an analytical person, and a data geek, I like the idea of auto-ethnography through collecting data. Especially if I can automate it so that it doesn\u2019t require me to constantly create the comms myself. Leaving a trace of the project in physical space when it is closely related to a specific area or context. I always like the transitions from physical to digital, and ways to bridge the two. Share my work as open-source; enable others to follow the same path and make it easy for them to not reinvent the wheel.","title":"Communication Strategy"},{"location":"term1/Communication/#communication-strategy","text":"It\u2019s hard to get noticed in our world.
